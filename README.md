# Starting-out
Projects that I have done and am doing.
At the moment I am editing CS:GO Cheats, which are actually BITWare copypastes. I also have smaller things that I have done myself, a calculator made in C++ and in Batch. I also have copy pasted DLL injector.

"Laskin" is a very simple calculator made in C++ and is in Finnish. It's not capable of calculating desimals and I do not know why.
"Simple batch calculator" is, well, a simple calculator made in batch.
